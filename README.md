I designed these shirts while consulting with the clinical team as for what best represents their interest. Sanguen Health is a Hep C clinic providing for the Waterloo-Wellington-Dufferin area, offering a variety of services to the local community. You can learn more about them <a href="https://sanguen.com/">here</a>. Each design is also available for purchase on their <a href= "https://sanguen.com/product-category/unisex/">web shop</a>.
